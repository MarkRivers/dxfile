======

This section contains links to python code examples to generate a :download:`simple.py <../../../doc/demo/simple.py>`
and a :download:`full.py <../../../doc/demo/full.py>` data-exchange file using the DXfile class.

We also provide a  :download:`dump_dxfile.py <../../../doc/demo/dump_dxfile.py>` to print the list of Groups and Datasets contained in an hdf file.
