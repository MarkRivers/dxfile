=====About=====Welcome to the Data Exchange file format web site (DXfile for short).The DXfile web site provides:    - The definition of the scientific data exchange   - HDF interface for writing scientific data exchange files   - XML attribute files for writing scientific data exchange file with the EPICS Area Detector HDF plug inData Exchange is a set of guidelines for storing scientific data andmetadata in a Hierarchical Data Format 5 (`HDF5 <http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5>`_)  file. The design guidelines for Data Exchange provide a starting point to which one may add customdata and metadata to solve particular problems.HDF5 has many important characteristics for scientific data storage. Itoffers platform-independent binary data storage with optionalcompression, hierarchical data ordering, and support for MPI-basedparallel computing. Data are stored with alphanumeric tags, so that onecan examine a HDF5 fileâ€™s contents with no knowledge of how the filewriting program was coded. Tools for this examination include theHDF5-supplied command-line utility`h5dump <http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/RM/Tools.html#Tools-Dump>`_to examine the contents of any HDF5 file, or the freely-available Javaprogram `HDFView <http://www.hdfgroup.org/hdf-java-html/hdfview/>`_to interactively examine the file.This reference guide describes the basic design principles of DataExchange, examples of their application, a core reference for guidelinescommon to most uses, and coding examples.
